WordPress is the world’s most popular content management system (CMS), with over 40% of all websites running on it. As such, it has become a prime target for hackers looking to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to websites. One of the best ways to enhance the security of a WordPress site is to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrators.

* Simply enable the plugin then edit a user account to enable 2FA for that individual user.
* Please make sure your WordPress website sends and receives emails correctly. The best way is to use a SMTP plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you are not receiving the email to login then in order to regain access to your account, you’ll have to disable the plugin. The only way to do this is by renaming the plugin folder from `two-factor-2fa-via-email` to `two-factor-2fa-via-email.backup` or equivalent.

	if(current_user_can('editor')) return 'https://custom.com/page/here';
	else return $URL;
	
});`
